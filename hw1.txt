NOTE: Name variants by location and give both the reference and sample alleles as in the VCF file.

Q: which variants are present in which samples?


Q: which variants are shared between two or more samples?


Q: are there any variants that stand out in terms of their likely biological impact?


notes to self during assignment:
already copied the reference genome (ecoli) as well as the four reads we are calling variants for
activate snakemake
while installing VEP, minimap2, bcftools, and samtools were all downgraded
if run into any issues in the future, know it could be due to this downgrade
mapping contains the above packages as well as VEP
